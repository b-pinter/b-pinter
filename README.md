Hi, I’m Brady! 👋

I am senior undergraduate student at Belmont University majoring in Data Science with Minors in Business Systems and Communications. I am interesting in topics like
- Machine Learning
- AI Development and Applications
- Bayesian Statistics
- Data Engineering

I have one major project I am working on currently at this moment
- Creation of a fullstack development for the prediction of UCL injuries for MLB pitchers using live-tracked pictches stretching back to 2020

Some of my other previous projects include
- Spring 2024 Research - Predicting Covid-19 Mortality Rates across the United States using publicly available social, economic indicators, and machine learning techniques like Least-Squares Regression, Multiple Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
- 2025 Leaderboard Contest - The creation of a AI model trained to generate numbers based on input from the MNIST dataset.
- Hackathon for Social Justice - A one-day hackathon with the goal of finding ways to improve transit solutions in Nashville TN. At this hackathon, my team and I took home first place for our transit renewal solution.
