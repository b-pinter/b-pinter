Hi, I'm Brady Pinter! 👋
- I'm a senior at Belmont University majoring in Data Science with minors in Business Systems and Analytics and Communications. I am interesting in learning more about machine learning and bayesian statistics, and applying things I have learned across a wide variety of projects.

##
🎯 Current Work
- One of my major projects right now is about Tommy John Surgery, a common issue that many MLB pitchers face. The goal of this project is to use bayesian methods and a hierarchial model to predict and avoid the surgery when possible.


##
🛠️ Skills
- Programming Languages : Python, R, SQL
- Tools and Libraries : Git, Matpollib, Seaborn, ggplot2, Scikit-Learn, STAN

**🚀 Featured Projects**

1. Tommy John Surgery Prediction Model
A comprehensive fullstack application designed to predict UCL (ulnar collateral ligament) injuries in MLB pitchers using live-tracked pitch data from 2020 onwards. This project combines advanced machine learning techniques with real-time baseball analytics to help identify injury risk factors and potentially prevent career-threatening injuries.
###
**Key Features:**
###
- Integration of live pitch-tracking data
- Predictive modeling for injury risk assessment
- Full-stack development with data pipeline automation

2. COVID-19 Mortality Rate Prediction
An independent research project analyzing the impact of socio-economic factors on COVID-19 mortality rates across the United States. Utilized multiple regression techniques including Least-Squares, Ridge, and Lasso Regression to identify key indicators affecting mortality outcomes.
###
**Key Insights:**
###
- Analyzed publicly available social and economic indicators
- Compared performance of various regression models
- Identified significant correlating factors in mortality rates.
